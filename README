                        PanSTARRS Rare Object TOols

                         Morganson & Marshall 2011


This is a loose collection of data-handling utilities put together at MPIA for
use by anyone in the PS1SC to search for rare objects, particularly in the 3pi
survey. 

The basic sequence of operations is:

  * Execute a dvo query script to select objects or sources with "avextract"
    or "mextract", and write the data to text file. At MPIA, this query may 
    include requests for columns from other surveys' databases (eq SDSS, WISE,
    2MASS, UKIDSS etc).
    
  * Optionally repackage this file as a FITS table

  * Perform further cuts / apply weights, to refine selection, generating 
    child tables.
    
  * Request postage stamp images of selected objects from Hawaii, via the
    postage stamp server.

  * Display information about each object, including:
      * Light curve statistics and graph
      * Postage stamps, colour or greyscale single filter
      * Webpages containing the above
